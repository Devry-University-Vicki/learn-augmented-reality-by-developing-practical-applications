# Free Augmented Reality Course

Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that combines computer-generated elements with the real world, enhancing the user's perception and interaction with their environment. AR overlays digital information such as images, videos, or 3D models onto the real world, usually through a smartphone, tablet, or wearable device.

## Use Cases of Augmented Reality

AR has a wide range of applications across various industries. Some common use cases of augmented reality include:

1. **Gaming**: AR has revolutionized the gaming industry by creating immersive and interactive experiences, allowing users to interact with virtual objects in their real environment.

2. **Education**: AR is being used in education to provide interactive and engaging learning experiences. It can bring static concepts to life, making it easier for students to understand complex subjects.

3. **Retail**: AR is used in retail to enhance the shopping experience. It allows customers to try on virtual clothes, visualize furniture in their homes before buying, and even see how products work through virtual demonstrations.

4. **Healthcare**: AR is being used in healthcare for various purposes, such as surgical training, patient education, and visualization of medical data.

5. **Architecture and Interior Design**: AR can be used to visualize and present architectural designs, allowing clients to see how a building or interior space will look before construction begins. It enables real-time adjustments and improvements, enhancing the design process.

6. **Navigation and Wayfinding**: AR can assist users in navigating their surroundings by overlaying directions, points of interest, and real-time information onto their field of view. This technology is particularly useful in complex indoor environments like airports, shopping malls, or museums.

7. **Virtual Try-On in Retail**: AR enables virtual try-on experiences, allowing customers to visualize how clothing, accessories, or cosmetics will look on them without physically trying them on. This enhances the online shopping experience and reduces returns.

# Solution
Hello, everyone! ðŸ‘‹ If you're having issues with AR Foundation because it's been upgraded to version 5.0 while the course uses version 4, don't worry! I've got solutions for your problems below.
## 1. Black Screen Issue
  - If you encounter a black screen after building the APK of your application, first, check if your device supports AR Core. If it does, ensure that AR Core is installed from the Play Store. Additionally, make sure you have ```Initialize XR on Startup``` and the ```AR Core plugin``` enabled in the XR Plugin Management tab under Project Settings ```Edit > Project Settings > XR Plugin Management (Android)```
    -  **[List of AR Core Supported Devices](https://developers.google.com/ar/devices)**
    -  **[Install AR Core from PlayStore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.ar.core&hl=en&gl=US)**
  - Another possible cause for a black screen is the absence of an AR Session in your scene. Adding an AR Session is crucial for AR Foundation to properly run through its lifecycle. Ensure you have included the AR Session in your scene to avoid encountering the black screen issue.
  - If you've set up your project using the URP Template, double-check that your URP Renderer includes the AR Background Renderer Feature. Failing to add this feature might result in a black screen when building on URP with AR Foundation. Ensure it's properly configured to avoid encountering the black screen issue.

## 2. AR Session Origin Depricated
Indeed, in the latest version, the AR Session Origin has been deprecated and replaced with XR Origin. However, it's important to note that the components within the script remain largely the same, with only minor changes. Update your scripts accordingly to accommodate this transition.
- Import ```using Unity.XR.CoreUtils;``` to make use of ```XROrigin``` rather than ```ARSessionOrigin```
- Replace ```[SerializeField] private ARSessionOrigin _sessionOrigin``` with ```[SerializeField] private XROrigin _xrOrigin;```
### Sample Code
```csharp
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using Unity.XR.CoreUtils;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation;
using UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems;

public class SimpleARPlacementManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private XROrigin _xrOrigin;
    [SerializeField] private ARPlaneManager _planeManager;
    [SerializeField] private ARRaycastManager _raycastManager;
    [SerializeField] private GameObject _placementObject;

    private GameObject _instantiatedObject = null;

    private List<ARRaycastHit> _raycastHits = new List<ARRaycastHit>();

    private void Update()
    {
        if(Input.touchCount > 0 && Input.GetTouch(0).phase == TouchPhase.Began)
        {
            bool collision = _raycastManager.Raycast(Input.GetTouch(0).position, _raycastHits, TrackableType.PlaneWithinPolygon);
            
            if(collision && _instantiatedObject == null)
            {
                _instantiatedObject = Instantiate(_placementObject, _raycastHits[0].pose.position, _raycastHits[0].pose.rotation);

                foreach(ARPlane plane in _planeManager.trackables)
                {
                    plane.gameObject.SetActive(false);
                }
                _planeManager.enabled = false;
            }
        }
    }
}

```
## 3. Mobile does not support ARCore
I acknowledge that not all smartphones support ARCore. Therefore, I recommend utilizing the XR Simulator offered by AR Foundation 5.0 for testing your AR experiences.
